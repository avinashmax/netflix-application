# 🎬 Netflix Application (Frontend Clone)

A Netflix-style web application built using **React + Vite** that allows users to browse and search movies with a modern UI inspired by Netflix.  
The app fetches movie data from the **OMDb API** and displays movie details with a responsive design.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://netflix-application-inky.vercel.app
